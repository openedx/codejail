# A central location for most common version constraints
# (across edx repos) for pip-installation.
#
# Similar to other constraint files this file doesn't install any packages.
# It specifies version constraints that will be applied if a package is needed.
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why it is a good
# idea to pin this package across all edx repos, Ideally, link to other information
# that will help people in the future to remove the pin when possible.
# Writing an issue against the offending project and linking to it here is good.
#
# Note: Changes to this file will automatically be used by other repos, referencing
#  this file from Github directly. It does not require packaging in edx-lint.

# pip 26 is incompatible with pip-tools hence causing failures during the build process
# Make upgrade command and all requirements upgrade jobs are broken due to this.
# The constraint can be removed once a release (pip-tools > 7.5.2) is available with support for pip 26
# Issue to track this dependency and unpin later on: https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/2319
