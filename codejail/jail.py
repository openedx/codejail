    """
    Self contained codejail type.

    This is the main class for working with codejails.  New codejails are
    configured and registered with `codejail.jail.configure()`.

    Creating a Jail takes four arguments:

        `command` is the abstract name of the command to run.  Each code jail
        can be configured and accessed using this name.

        Examples: `"python"`, `"nodejs"`.

        `bin_path` is the path to the system executable to be run.

        Examples: `"/edx/app/edxapp-sandbox/bin/python3"`, `"/usr/bin/ruby"`.

        `user` is the name of a system user to run jailed code as.  The user
        should be configured under AppArmor to protect it from executing
        malicious code, but codejail does not check this.  If set to `None`,
        the code will be run as the same user that is running the codejail
        instance.

        Examples: `"sandbox"`, `None`

        `lang` is a reference to a `codejail.languages.Language` object.  This
        tells codejail how to run a particular command, including what
        command-line arguments to pass to the bin_path executable, and how
        to wrap code to run under safe_exec, if desired.

    Jails can be retrieved with `codejail.jail.get_codejail(cmd)`, where
    `cmd` is the abstract command name of the Jail.

    To use a codejail, call either its `jail_code()` or `safe_exec()` method
    with the documented arguments.

    `jail_code()` runs a snippet of code under the given command, and returns
    its exit code and output.

    `safe_exec()` runs the code with an explicitly defined dict of global
    variables, and updates the dict with any variables assigned during
    execution of the code.

        Execute code as "exec" does, but safely.

        `code` is a string of Python code.  `globals_dict` is used as the globals
        during execution.  Modifications the code makes to `globals_dict` are
        reflected in the dictionary on return.

        `files` is a list of file paths, either files or directories.  They will be
        copied into the temp directory used for execution.  No attempt is made to
        determine whether the file is appropriate or safe to copy.  The caller must
        determine which files to provide to the code.

        `python_path` is a list of directory or file paths.  These names will be
        added to `sys.path` so that modules they contain can be imported.  Only
        directories and zip files are supported.  If the name is not provided in
        `extra_files`, it will be copied just as if it had been listed in `files`.

        `slug` is an arbitrary string, a description that's meaningful to the
        caller, that will be used in log messages.

        `extra_files` is a list of pairs, each pair is a filename and a bytestring
        of contents to write into that file.  These files will be created in the
        temp directory and cleaned up automatically.  No subdirectories are
        supported in the filename.

        Returns None.  Changes made by `code` are visible in `globals_dict`.  If
        the code raises an exception, this function will raise `SafeExecException`
        with the stderr of the sandbox process, which usually includes the original
        exception message and traceback.
