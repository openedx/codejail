    Execute code as "exec" does, but safely.

    `code` is a string of Python code.  `globals_dict` is used as the globals
    during execution.  Modifications the code makes to `globals_dict` are
    reflected in the dictionary on return.

    `files` is a list of file paths, either files or directories.  They will be
    copied into the temp directory used for execution.  No attempt is made to
    determine whether the file is appropriate or safe to copy.  The caller must
    determine which files to provide to the code.

    `python_path` is a list of directory or file paths.  These names will be
    added to `sys.path` so that modules they contain can be imported.  Only
    directories and zip files are supported.  If the name is not provided in
    `extras_files`, it will be copied just as if it had been listed in `files`.

    `limit_overrides_context` is an optional string to use as a key against the
    configured limit overrides contexts. If omitted or if no such limit override context
    has been configured, then use the default limits.

    `slug` is an arbitrary string, a description that's meaningful to the
    caller, that will be used in log messages.

    `extra_files` is a list of pairs, each pair is a filename and a bytestring
    of contents to write into that file.  These files will be created in the
    temp directory and cleaned up automatically.  No subdirectories are
    supported in the filename.

    Returns None.  Changes made by `code` are visible in `globals_dict`.  If
    the code raises an exception, this function will raise `SafeExecException`
    with the stderr of the sandbox process, which usually includes the original
    exception message and traceback.
