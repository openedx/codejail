    Set a limit for jailed code.

    `limit_name` is a string, the name of the limit to set. `value` is the
    value to use for that limit.  The type, meaning, default, and range of
    accepted values depend on `limit_name`.

    These limits are available:

        * `"CPU"`: the maximum number of CPU seconds the jailed code can use.
            The value is an integer, defaulting to 1.

        * `"REALTIME"`: the maximum number of seconds the jailed code can run,
            in real time.  The default is 1 second.

        * `"VMEM"`: the total virtual memory available to the jailed code, in
            bytes.  The default is 0 (no memory limit).

        * `"FSIZE"`: the maximum size of files creatable by the jailed code,
            in bytes.  The default is 0 (no files may be created).

        * `"NPROC"`: the maximum number of process or threads creatable by the
            jailed code.  The default is 15.

        * `"PROXY"`: 1 to use a proxy process, 0 to not use one. This isn't
            really a limit, sorry about that.

    Limits are process-wide, and will affect all future calls to jail_code.
    Providing a limit of 0 will disable that limit.
